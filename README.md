## Approach & Methodology

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Objective**: Perform basic analysis and identify key trends and patterns in the data.
- **Steps**:
  - Load and clean data.
  - Conduct univariate and bivariate analysis.
  - Visualize distributions and relationships.
  - Handle missing values and perform necessary data preprocessing.

### 2. **Lookalike Model**
- **Objective**: Build a model to predict customers that are similar to the most valuable customers.
- **Steps**:
  - Feature engineering using historical transaction data.
  - Train a predictive model using relevant features.
  - Evaluate model performance and tune the model accordingly.

### 3. **Clustering (Customer Segmentation)**
- **Objective**: Segment customers into groups based on transactional behavior for targeted marketing.
- **Steps**:
  - Use KMeans clustering to segment customers.
  - Analyze cluster centers to understand the characteristics of each customer group.
  - Draw business insights from the clustering results.

## Conclusion
- **EDA** helped uncover important patterns in the customer and transaction data.
- **Lookalike Model** was useful for identifying customer groups similar to high-value customers, aiding targeted marketing.
- **Clustering** allowed for segmenting customers based on their behavior, enabling personalized marketing strategies.
